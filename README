Required R packages: rstan, data.table, dplyr, doMC (or at least foreach). 

Key files: 
  - molecular_data.R processes the raw cell line data and produces distance matrices. It addtionally performs imputation for GE for two cell lines from CCLE and for methylation. 
  - mono_pca_all.R performs a nuclear-norm regularized PCA on the monotherapy data
  - sub1_partAandB.R This is run to produce results for subchallenge 1. Part A is run with 
  Rscript sub1_partAandB.R A
and part B with
  Rscript sub1_partAandB.R B
