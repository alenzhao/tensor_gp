Required R packages: rstan, data.table, dplyr, doMC (or at least foreach). 

Key files: 
  - molecular_data.R processes the raw cell line data and produces distance matrices. It addtionally performs imputation for GE for two cell lines from CCLE and for methylation. 
  - mono_pca_all.R performs a nuclear-norm regularized PCA on the monotherapy data
  - train_gp.R This is run to produce results for all challenge tasks. e.g. part A is run with 
  Rscript train_gp.R 1 final2 A #cores 1
